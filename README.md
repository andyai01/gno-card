# gNo Card

This hereby project, **gNo Card**, is meant to act an _extension_ to the existing _card-plus-account_ **Gnosis** system. With the use of _gNo Card_ ( where the letter **G** is a silent letter, therefore _NoCard_ ), the user will be able to buy goods and services in places where the **GnosisPay VISA** card doesn't work.

The _gNoCard_ system will allow the user that already has a **Safe** to still use his / her crypto monies / stable-coin monies to pay for things ( like groceries, travel, luxuries, and so on ) in places where non-crypto systems are in place and the user's VISA doesn't work or in cases where the there is a problem with the card itself. This will be achieved trough workarounds like vouchers, coupons, prepaid-cards, cross-wish-list purchases and so on.
