# gNo Card

This hereby project, **gNo Card**, is meant to act an _extension_ to the existing _card-plus-account_ **Gnosis** system. With the use of _gNo Card_ ( where the letter **G** is a silent letter, therefore _NoCard_ ), the user will be able to buy goods and services in places where the **GnosisPay VISA** card doesn't work.

The _gNoCard_ system will allow the user that already has a **Safe** to still use his / her crypto monies / stable-coin monies to pay for things ( like groceries, travel, luxuries, and so on ) in places where non-crypto systems are in place and the user's VISA doesn't work or in cases where the there is a problem with the card itself. This will be achieved trough workarounds like vouchers, coupons, prepaid-cards, cross-wish-list purchases and so on. Everything will happen seamlessly with basically one click.

One can think of **gNoCard** like an _off-ramp_ to fiat / to something fiat-like where all the friction is removed.

This has the potential to also add ability to anonymously purchases of goods and services.

## Project Description

Below is a high level description of ONE of the mechanisms by we will add an off-ramp fiat system:

1. User goes to the [gnosispay.com](https://gnosispay.com/);

2. The on-boarding platform shows two options: A). the legacy full-KYC option; B). the minimum-user verification option;

3. User selects option B;

4. User gives the minimum information about himself / herself like email address;

5. User checks his / her _Safe_ account address like **`0xa1ce ...`**;

6. User tops up his / her account with EURe, GBPe, USDC etc;

7. User goes to the shop in a country where **VISA** is **NOT** accepted ( see below );

8. User after getting prompted with a message selects a way to pay for groceries with the use of a Voucher with just one tap ( this implies that the user is using the GnosisPay dashboard trough the Browser / there is a native GnosisPay app ).

9. END.
